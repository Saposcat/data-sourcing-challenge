# data-sourcing-challenge
This is the repository for assignment 6, which sources data directly from APIs.
Because I do not wish to make my API key public, I will draw from a personal
API file which I will store in the working directory; everyone will have to 
Configure their own file. It is a simple text document, and it can be done
by making a .txt file with the following lines of code:

NYT_API_KEY="ENTER YOUR KEY HERE"

TMDB_API_KEY="ENTER YOUR KEY HERE"

The file should then be saved and called "API_Keys" to work with the code provided;
In my case I had to save the file as a .txt, but .env may work better for others.
